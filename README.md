# üëæ Hide Shellcode Payload in Images üëæ
**-> A project that demonstrates embedding shellcode payloads into image files (like PNGs) using Python and extracting them using C/C++. Payloads can be retrieved directly from the file on disk or from the image stored in a binary's resources section (.rsrc)**
